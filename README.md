# FX Rate Aggregation Service

## Initial Thought Process
Free users lose trust due to errors and stale data.
This project focuses on reliability and transparency rather than real-time accuracy.

## How to Run

### Backend
cd backend  
npm install  
npm start  

### Frontend
cd frontend  
npm install  
npm start  

## Stack
- Node.js (Express)
- React
- Public FX APIs

## Notes
This is a deliberately minimal implementation to ship within limited time.
